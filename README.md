<p id="description">In this end-to-end project I created a Movie Recommendation System that provides 5 top recommendations based on the movie you have viewed. For recommendations it includes a dataset of more than 4000 movies. Additionally it loads the specific movie poster from the TMDB api. The final project that was deployed also includes a section for popular movies and has the ability to sort movies by genre.</p>

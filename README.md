<p id="description">I have developed a content-based movie recommendation system for this end-to-end project that offers 5 best picks depending on the film you've seen. It has a dataset of more than 4000 movies for recommendations. The unique movie poster is also loaded using the TMDB api. The finished product that was put into use also offers a section for well-known films and allows you to sort films by genre.</p>
